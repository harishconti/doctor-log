# Requirements and Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Medical Contacts API, the requirements for a production environment, and the current implementation status.

## 1. Existing Architecture

The backend is a modern Python web application built with the FastAPI framework. It follows a modular and service-oriented architecture.

### 1.1. Core Technologies

- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** MongoDB (asynchronous via `motor`)
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using `python-jose` and `passlib` for password hashing.
- **Data Validation:** Pydantic for data validation and settings management.
- **Web Server:** Uvicorn (for development)

### 1.2. Directory Structure

The application code is organized into the following modules within the `backend/app/` directory:

- **`api/`**: Contains the API endpoint definitions (routers).
  - `auth.py`: Handles user authentication, token generation, and user registration.
  - `patients.py`: Manages patient data (CRUD operations).
- **`core/`**: Core application logic and configuration.
  - `config.py`: Manages application settings and environment variables.
- **`db/`**: Database-related code.
  - `session.py`: Handles the database connection lifecycle.
  - `init_db.py`: Contains logic to initialize the database with dummy data on startup.
- **`models/`**: Pydantic models representing the data structures stored in the database.
- **`schemas/`**: Pydantic schemas for API request and response validation.
- **`services/`**: Contains the business logic of the application, separating it from the API layer.

## 2. Production Environment Requirements

To deploy the application in a live production environment, the following components and services are recommended:

### 2.1. Infrastructure

- **Web Server:** A production-grade ASGI server like Gunicorn or Uvicorn running behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.
- **Load Balancer:** To distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application for high availability and scalability.
- **Database:** A managed MongoDB cluster (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) is recommended for automated backups, scaling, and monitoring.
- **Caching:** A caching layer (e.g., Redis) can be used to store frequently accessed data and reduce database load.

### 2.2. Monitoring and Logging

- **Monitoring:** A monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus with Grafana, or a commercial APM tool) to track application performance, error rates, and resource utilization.
- **Logging:** Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to aggregate logs from all application instances for easier debugging and analysis.

### 2.3. CI/CD

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment.

## 3. Implementation Status

This section describes the current state of the application's implementation.

### 3.1. What is Done

- **Core API Functionality:** The core API for user authentication and patient management is implemented.
- **Modular Architecture:** The codebase is well-structured into modules for API, services, models, and database interactions.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with token refresh is in place.
- **Development Environment:** The application is runnable in a development environment using `uvicorn`.
- **Unit Tests:** A test suite (`backend_test.py`) exists for testing the backend functionality.

### 3.2. What is Mimicked

- **Database:** The application uses a local MongoDB instance. For development, it is initialized with dummy data via `init_dummy_data` on startup. This is a stand-in for a production-grade database cluster.
- **Web Server:** The built-in `uvicorn` development server is used. This is a substitute for a more robust production server setup with Gunicorn/Nginx.

### 3.3. What needs to be Implemented

The following components are not yet implemented and are required for a production-ready system:

- **Production Infrastructure:**
  - Setup of a production web server (Gunicorn/Nginx).
  - Configuration of a load balancer.
  - Migration to a managed database service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Integration with a monitoring solution.
  - Implementation of centralized logging.
- **CI/CD:**
  - Creation of a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- **Caching:**
  - Implementation of a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Comprehensive security audit.
  - Implementation of rate limiting and other security best practices.
