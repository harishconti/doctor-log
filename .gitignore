# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending
#   on the platform. These differences will end up in the Pipfile.lock, which can be problematic.
#   Please consider reading the Pipenv documentation here: https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/basics/#pipfile-lock
#   and watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBQ2u9NkLfc

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   The poetry.lock file is cross-platform by default.
