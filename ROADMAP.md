## 1. Mobile App (React Native)

### ✅ Completed Features

- **Core Subscription & Auth:**
  - [x] Enhanced global state (Zustand) to store user's subscription plan, status, and trial end date.
  - [x] Login process correctly populates subscription state from the backend.
  - [x] Fixed critical state hydration issue, ensuring the app loads correctly.
- **Conditional UI:**
  - [x] Profile screen displays the user's current plan and trial status.
  - [x] Pro-level features are visually locked for Basic/Trial users.
  - [x] UI elements like "Upgrade" buttons are displayed conditionally.
- **Payment Integration:**
  - [x] A dedicated "Upgrade" screen outlines Pro plan benefits.
  - [x] The checkout flow is implemented, calling the backend to create a secure checkout session.
- **Data Layer:**
  - [x] **Offline Support:** Initial WatermelonDB setup is complete and configured correctly for web builds. *(Note: Full functionality is blocked by the missing backend sync API).*

### ⏳ Pending Features

- **Core Functionality:**
    - [ ] **Input Validation:** The Zod validation schema for patients (`patientSchema`) is missing, preventing the creation and editing of patients.
- **Document Management (Pro Feature):** *(Depends on: Backend Image Storage)*
  - [ ] Implement the document upload UI on the patient detail screen. 
  - [ ] Implement a view to list, download, and manage a patient's uploaded documents.
- **General Improvements:**
  - [ ] **UI/UX:** Add haptic feedback and more advanced loading states.

## 2. Web Dashboard (React.js) - *New Build*

This is a new, Pro-exclusive application to be built from scratch.

### ⏳ Pending Features

- **Core Architecture:**
  - [ ] Set up a new React.js project (e.g., with Next.js).
  - [ ] Implement shared authentication logic to connect to the existing backend.
  - [ ] Implement a "Pro User" route guard to protect the entire dashboard.
- **Feature Development:**
  - [ ] **Analytics Dashboard:** Develop components to visualize key practice metrics from the `/api/analytics` endpoints.
  - [ ] **Advanced Patient Management:** Build a comprehensive data grid (e.g., MUI X, AG Grid) for searching, sorting, and filtering patients.
  - [ ] **Appointment Calendar:** Implement a full-featured calendar for appointment management using a library like FullCalendar. *(Depends on: Backend Appointments API)*

## 3. Backend (FastAPI)

### ✅ Completed Features

- **Core APIs:**
  - [x] User Authentication and Registration.
  - [x] Patient and Clinical Note Management (CRUD).
- **Subscription & Payments:**
  - [x] Payment gateway integration for creating checkout sessions.
  - [x] Webhook endpoint to handle payment status updates.
- **Pro-Tier APIs:**
  - [x] API endpoints for `Documents` and `Analytics` are implemented and protected.
- **Security & Stability:**
  - [x] **RBAC:** Finalized and polished Role-Based Access Control. New users are correctly assigned the `DOCTOR` role.

  - [x] **Server-Side Validation:** Enhanced validation for patient and clinical note data.

### ⏳ Pending Features

- **Core Functionality:**
  - [ ] **Data Synchronization API:** Implement `/api/sync/pull` and `/api/sync/push` endpoints required by the frontend's WatermelonDB client.
  - [ ] **Appointments:** Develop API endpoints for appointment management.
  - [ ] **Image Storage:** Integrate with a cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary) for document files.

## 4. General / Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] **Error Handling:** Integrate a monitoring service like Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics across both frontend and backend.
- [ ] **Performance:** Conduct performance analysis and implement optimizations like code splitting.
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Enhance accessibility to meet standard guidelines (WCAG).
